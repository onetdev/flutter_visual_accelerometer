# Flutter visual accelerometer

This is just a very simple flutter application displaying values from accelerometer and gyroscope. (Only tested on Android device)

The display for the coordinates is just a simple 2D rotate and no 3D has been used.

I do not plan to update this repository but you are free to use it. 

## How it looks
